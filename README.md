# CovidDataAnalysis

This project uses Covid-19 infection data (from the source below). I first created a database on my machine where each table was a file from the source. To teach myself SQL Server, I then performed every query I could possibly think of which would have interesting data, and I specifically made an effort to make these queries as effecient as possible. I then used the queried data to create a dashboard with Tableau. My Tableau Public profile link (which contains some dashboards with this data) is https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas.o4919

Data is through 24/08/2021 from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

Thanks to the following for the data:
